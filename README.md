# Ultra‑Strict Python Project Template

Maximum strictness for Python projects, inspired by TypeScript’s `--strict` mode.

This repo provides a **`pyproject.toml` template** and tooling configuration so you can:

- **Start new projects** in strict mode by copying the template.
- **Upgrade existing projects** by reusing only the pieces you need.

The goal is **production‑grade quality** from day one: strong typing, clean style, security checks, and good test coverage.

---

## Features

- **Python**: 3.12+
- **Dependency manager**: `uv`
- **Type checker**: `basedpyright` (strict mode)
- **Linter / formatter**: `ruff` (with many plugins enabled)
- **Config & env**: `python-dotenv`, `typing-extensions`
- **Data validation**: `pydantic>=2`
- **Task runner**: `poethepoet` (format, check, metrics, etc.)
- **Code quality tools**: `radon`, `skylos`
- **Testing & coverage**: `pytest` + `coverage` (80% minimum by default)

Everything is wired through **`pyproject.toml`** so you have a single source of truth.

## Using this for a New Project

1. **Create a new directory**:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

2. **Copy the template `pyproject.toml`** from this repo and adapt it:

   - Change `[project]` fields:
     - `name = "my-project"`
     - `description = "My strict Python project"`
     - `authors = [...]`
   - Update `tool.ruff.lint.isort.known-first-party` to match your package name, e.g.:

     ```toml
     known-first-party = ["my_project"]
     ```

3. **Create the basic structure**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/my_project tests
   touch src/my_project/__init__.py
   touch tests/__init__.py
   ```

4. **Create and activate a virtual environment (with `uv`)**:

   ```bash
   uv venv
   # Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # Linux / macOS
   # source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Install dependencies (including dev tooling)**:

   ```bash
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

You now have a new project in **strict mode**.

## Using this with an Existing Project

You don’t have to adopt everything at once. For an existing codebase you can **gradually** copy pieces of this template:

1. **Back up your current `pyproject.toml`** (or `setup.cfg`, `requirements.txt`, etc.).

2. **Copy selected sections** from this template `pyproject.toml`:

   - `[project]` (or integrate relevant fields into your existing project metadata).
   - `[project.optional-dependencies].dev` (to add `basedpyright`, `ruff`, `poethepoet`, etc.).
   - `[tool.ruff]` and `[tool.ruff.*]` blocks to adopt strict linting/formatting.
   - `[tool.basedpyright...]` block to enable strict type checking.
   - `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` and `[tool.coverage.*]` to standardize tests/coverage.

3. **Simplify if needed**:

   - You can **relax some rules** initially (e.g. unused variables, unknown types) and then tighten them once the code is cleaner.
   - You can **exclude noisy directories** (generated code, legacy folders) in the `exclude` lists for `ruff`, `basedpyright`, and coverage.

4. **Install the dev dependencies** in your existing project:

   ```bash
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

5. **Set up pre-commit hooks** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   # Install pre-commit hooks
   uv run pre-commit install
   uv run pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
   
   # Optional: run on all files to verify
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   
   # Update hooks periodically
   uv run pre-commit autoupdate
   ```

6. **Run the tools and fix issues iteratively** (see commands below).

---

## Commands & Workflow

You can use the raw tools or the `poethepoet` tasks defined in `pyproject.toml`.

### Daily workflow (direct commands)

```bash
# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Lint and auto-fix
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Strict type checking
uv run basedpyright --log-level error

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest
```

### Poe tasks

```bash
# Format, lint (with auto-fix), and strict type check
uv run poe format

# Lint + strict type check (no auto-fix)
uv run poe check

# Lint only (with auto-fix)
uv run poe lint

# Lint with unsafe fixes
uv run poe lint-unsafe

# Quality metrics (vulture + radon)
uv run poe metrics

# Full quality pipeline (format + lint + type check + metrics)
uv run poe quality
```

These tasks are configured in `[tool.poe.tasks]` in `pyproject.toml` and you can customize them as needed.

## Strictness Philosophy

This template targets **maximum strictness**, roughly equivalent to:

- TypeScript `--strict`
- Python with `basedpyright` in `strict` mode
- Aggressive linting via `ruff` with many plugins enabled

That means:

- No implicit `Any` (unknown/untyped values are treated as errors).
- Required type annotations on function parameters and return types.
- Unused imports, variables, functions, and classes are treated as errors.
- Optional values (`None`) must be handled explicitly.
- Security‑oriented checks via `flake8-bandit` rules.
- Coverage threshold enforced by default (80%).

If this is too strict for an existing project, you can **progressively relax** some `basedpyright` or `ruff` rules and then turn them back on as your code improves.

## Anti-Slop: Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development

This template is specifically designed to prevent common "LLM slop" - the anti-patterns that AI code assistants tend to produce. Here are key patterns to follow:

### 1. **Pydantic Models for All IO**

Never work with raw dictionaries, JSON, or untyped data. Always define a Pydantic model and validate **immediately** at the boundary:

```python
# ❌ BAD: Raw dict from API/file
def process_user_data(data: dict) -> None:
    name = data["name"]  # Could fail, no validation
    age = data.get("age", 0)  # Type is Any

# ✅ GOOD: Pydantic model + immediate validation
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class UserData(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(min_length=1)
    age: int = Field(ge=0, le=150)

def process_user_data(data: dict) -> None:
    user = UserData.model_validate(data)  # Fails fast with clear errors
    # Now user.name and user.age are fully typed and validated
```

This applies to:
- **API responses**: `response.json()` → immediate `Model.model_validate()`
- **Config files**: `json.load()` → immediate `Model.model_validate()`
- **CLI arguments**: `argparse.Namespace` → convert to Pydantic model
- **Environment variables**: Use `pydantic-settings` instead of raw `os.getenv()`

### 2. **Dataframe Schemas with Pandera** (if using pandas/polars)

If you work with DataFrames, uncomment Pandera in dependencies and always define schemas:

```python
import pandera as pa
from pandera.typing import DataFrame

class SalesSchema(pa.DataFrameModel):
    product_id: int = pa.Field(gt=0)
    revenue: float = pa.Field(ge=0)
    date: pa.DateTime

def process_sales(df: DataFrame[SalesSchema]) -> DataFrame[SalesSchema]:
    validated = SalesSchema.validate(df, lazy=True)
    # Now every column is typed and validated
    return validated
```

### 3. **Avoid Boolean Traps**

The `FBT` rule catches this common LLM mistake:

```python
# ❌ BAD: What does True mean here?
send_email(user, True, False)

# ✅ GOOD: Use enums or keyword-only args
from enum import Enum

class EmailFormat(Enum):
    HTML = "html"
    PLAIN = "plain"

def send_email(
    user: User,
    *,  # Force keyword-only
    format: EmailFormat,
    async_send: bool = False
) -> None: ...

send_email(user, format=EmailFormat.HTML, async_send=False)
```

### 4. **Keep Functions Simple**

This template enforces:
- **Max complexity: 10** (McCabe)
- **Max nested blocks: 3** (no deeply nested if/for/while)

If you hit these limits, refactor into smaller functions:

```python
# ❌ BAD: Complex nested logic
def process_order(order):
    if order.valid:
        if order.in_stock:
            if order.payment_ok:
                if order.address_valid:
                    # 4 levels deep!
                    ...

# ✅ GOOD: Early returns + helper functions
def process_order(order: Order) -> None:
    if not order.valid:
        raise InvalidOrderError()
    if not order.in_stock:
        raise OutOfStockError()

    validate_payment(order)
    validate_address(order)
    ship_order(order)
```

### 5. **No Bare Excepts**

LLMs love `except Exception:` or bare `except:`. The `BLE` rule catches this:

```python
# ❌ BAD: Hides all errors
try:
    risky_operation()
except Exception:  # BLE001 error
    pass

# ✅ GOOD: Catch specific exceptions
try:
    risky_operation()
except (ValueError, KeyError) as e:
    logger.error(f"Expected error: {e}")
    raise
```

## VS Code Setup (Recommended)

In a project using this template, a typical `.vscode/settings.json` would:

- Point VS Code to `.venv` as the default interpreter.
- Enable strict type checking.
- Use `ruff` as formatter and linter.
- Run organize‑imports and fix‑all on save.

You can copy the suggested settings from the original template comments or adapt them to your editor of choice.

---

## When to Use This Template

- **Greenfield projects** where you want high confidence and maintainability.
- **Existing projects** that you want to gradually migrate to a stricter, safer style.
- **Libraries/SDKs** that will be consumed by others and must provide strong type guarantees.

If you want to relax the rules (e.g., for experimental code or quick scripts), you can:

- Lower coverage thresholds.
- Downgrade some `basedpyright` diagnostics from errors to warnings.
- Disable specific `ruff` rules or directories.

---

## Next Steps

- Adjust `[project]` metadata to match your package.
- Update `known-first-party` in the `ruff` config.
- Add your source code under `src/` and tests under `tests/`.
- Run `uv run poe quality` before every commit or CI run.

This template is designed so you can **copy it wholesale** for new projects or **cherry‑pick** sections for older ones, while keeping the same strict philosophy throughout your Python codebase.
